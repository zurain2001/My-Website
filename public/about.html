    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>My name is Zurain Zeeshan, and I am a junior at Whitman College studying Economics and Computer Science. </p>
        <p>I am from Karachi, Pakistan, and when I was 16,
        I left home to complete my high school education in Costa Rica on a full scholarship. I attended the United World College and completed the International Baccalaureate Diploma. After my high school, I got another scholarship to complete 
        my Bachelors degree in the US, in Walla Walla, Washington.</p> 

        <p>I am a Full Stack Engineer, however, I have other hobbies that I love, such as photography and making short films.
        I like to travel and record my memories on my camera. I usually post my photographs on my Instagram account and some videos on my YouTube channel.
